The cluster function is in 'cluster_function_kmeans_mah.R' file. 
Use 'cluster_sample.R' to generate the result of cluster.
Note: we only use 3 as cluster number, which references the output of two packages based on distance.(recommend_cluster_num.docx)
The cluster analysis uses Mahalanobis Distance, from year 2005 to 2019.
The file 'cluster2019_two_dist.R' is a sample code for do the cluster for 2019, using two methods, 
  Mahalanobis Distance and Euclidian Distance. 
The file 'merge.R' is the code for preparing the data for clustering, it's output file is 'crime_cluster.rds'.
The file 'sample_for_cluster.csv' is the file prepared for plotting in map.
